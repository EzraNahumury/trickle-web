## Overview

**Trickle** is a non-custodial payroll-streaming protocol built natively for the **Celo** stablecoin economy and surfaced as a **MiniApp inside MiniPay**. Employers deposit stablecoins once, open a per-second salary stream to each employee, and the employee can withdraw their accrued earnings at any moment — no payday, no batch processing, no intermediaries.

It is heavily inspired by [LlamaPay](https://llamapay.io/), but ships where LlamaPay does not: on Celo, in front of **14M+ MiniPay users**, with sub-cent withdrawal fees and gas-payable-in-stablecoins.

> **The thesis** — Salary should accrue at the same cadence people actually live: by the second, not by the month.

---

## The problem

| Today | Why it hurts |
|---|---|
| Salary lands once or twice a month | Workers in emerging markets carry weeks of liquidity risk |
| Crypto payroll lives on L1 / L2s with high fees | A $0.50 withdrawal makes no sense if gas is $3 |
| Existing streaming protocols (LlamaPay, Sablier) **are not on Celo** | The chain with the best stablecoin UX has zero payroll-streaming infra |
| Web3 payroll dApps assume desktop + browser wallets | Most of the target market only has a phone |

Celo solves the cost and distribution side. Trickle is the missing application layer.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    E["Employer<br/>(MiniPay)"]
    V["TrickleVault<br/>Smart Contract"]
    P["Employee<br/>(MiniPay)"]

    E -- "1. deposit(token, amount)" --> V
    E -- "2. createStream(payee, token, ratePerSec)" --> V
    V -. "accrues per-second<br/>fully on-chain" .-> P
    P -- "3. withdraw(payer, token, ratePerSec)" --> V
    V -- "stablecoin payout" --> P

    classDef actor fill:#0F1119,stroke:#3A4055,color:#F5F7FB;
    class V vault
    class E,P actor
```

1. **Employer** deposits stablecoins into the `TrickleVault` and opens a stream with a flat per-second rate.
2. **The vault** records `lastPaid` and accrues `amountPerSec * elapsed` of salary on every block — no oracle, no keeper, no off-chain cron.
3. **Employee** can call `withdraw(...)` anytime to pull whatever has accrued so far. If the vault has run dry, the call pays out whatever is available and advances `lastPaid` proportionally so nothing is lost.

The whole accounting model is one struct and three storage maps. It is intentionally boring — boring is what payroll should be.

## Smart contract reference

`TrickleVault` is a single, dependency-light Solidity contract. The full source is in [`sc_trickle/src/TrickleVault.sol`](./sc_trickle/src/TrickleVault.sol).

### Stream lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Funded: deposit(token, amount)
    Funded --> Streaming: createStream(payee, token, ratePerSec)

    Streaming --> Streaming: withdraw() — partial, lastPaid advances
    Funded --> Streaming: deposit() — top up
    Streaming --> Funded: cancelStream() — settles pending pay
    Streaming --> [*]: payer withdrawBalance(remaining)
    Funded --> [*]: payer withdrawBalance(all)
```

### Public API

```solidity
// ── Employer ──────────────────────────────────────────────
function deposit(address token, uint256 amount) external;
function withdrawBalance(address token, uint256 amount) external;
function createStream(address payee, address token, uint216 amountPerSec) external;
function cancelStream(address payee, address token, uint216 amountPerSec) external;

// ── Employee ──────────────────────────────────────────────
function withdraw(address payer, address token, uint216 amountPerSec) external;

// ── Views ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
function withdrawable(address payer, address payee, address token, uint216 amountPerSec)
    external view returns (uint256);
function getStream(bytes32 streamId) external view returns (Stream memory);
function getPayerStreamIds(address payer) external view returns (bytes32[] memory);
function getPayeeStreamIds(address payee) external view returns (bytes32[] memory);
function getStreamId(address payer, address payee, address token, uint216 amountPerSec)
    external pure returns (bytes32);
```

### Events

| Event | Emitted when |
|---|---|
| `Deposit(payer, token, amount)` | Employer funds the vault |
| `BalanceWithdrawn(payer, token, amount)` | Employer pulls back unstreamed balance |
| `StreamCreated(streamId, payer, payee, token, amountPerSec)` | New stream opened |
| `StreamCancelled(streamId, payer, payee, token)` | Stream closed; pending pay settled |
| `Withdrawn(streamId, payee, payer, amount)` | Employee claims accrued earnings |

### Per-second rate math

```
amountPerSec = monthlySalary × 10^decimals / 2_592_000

# $1,000/month in USDC (6 decimals):
amountPerSec = 1_000 × 10^6 / 2_592_000 ≈ 385_802 (wei/sec)
```

The contract clamps payouts at the available vault balance — a stream never reverts when the employer underfunds; it just pays whatever is there and advances `lastPaid` proportionally so the employee can claim the rest after a top-up.

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 20+** and **npm**
- **Foundry** (`curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && foundryup`)
- A wallet with a sliver of CELO for gas (or use Sepolia + the [Celo faucet](https://faucet.celo.org))

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/trickle.git
cd trickle
```

### 2. Smart contracts

```bash
cd sc_trickle
forge install                      # pull forge-std
forge build                        # compile
forge test -vvv                    # full test suite (no internet needed)

cp .env.example .env               # add PRIVATE_KEY + CELOSCAN_API_KEY
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url celo-sepolia --broadcast --verify -vvvv
```

Full Foundry recipe (mainnet deploy, cast cheatsheet, gas report) lives in [`sc_trickle/README.md`](./sc_trickle/README.md).

### 3. Frontend

```bash
cd fe_trickle
npm install
npm run dev                        # http://localhost:3000
```

`config/chains.ts` already points at the live mainnet vault. Override with env vars if you redeploy:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_TRICKLE_VAULT_ADDRESS_MAINNET=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_TRICKLE_VAULT_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...   # tUSDC faucet token on Sepolia
```

### 4. (Optional) heartbeat script

Keeps the protocol's onchain footprint warm for the Celo Proof-of-Ship leaderboard.

```bash
cd scripts
npm install
cp .env.example .env               # PRIVATE_KEY, VAULT_ADDRESS, TOKEN_ADDRESS, CHAIN
npm run spam
```

See [`scripts/README.md`](./scripts/README.md) for tuning knobs.

## MiniApp surfaces

| Route | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | — | Onboarding · brand pill, hero illustration, primary CTA |
| `/home` | both | Role select (Employer / Employee) after wallet connect |
| `/employer` | payer | Vault overview · token tabs · 3-action row · active streams |
| `/employer/create` | payer | New stream form — payee, token, monthly rate, review |
| `/employer/batch` | payer | **Batch payroll** — add many payees in one flow (CSV import + multi-stream review) |
| `/employee` | payee | Live withdrawable counter · area chart · withdraw all |
| `/employee/payslip` | payee | **Payslip view** — earnings history, tx receipts, **PDF export** |
| `/employee/request` | payee | **Payment request link** — generate shareable URL for one-off invoices |
| `/pay` | payer | Landing for inbound request links — parsed amount, token, payee, one-click confirm |

The visual system is a dark-indigo SaaS aesthetic (background `#0A0B14`, surfaces `#161927`, accent `#6366F1`), tuned for restraint — Stripe / Linear / Ramp as references, not generic web3 dApps. **Light/dark theme** toggle preserved via `ThemeProvider`.

---

## Use cases

Trickle is a single primitive — a per-second stream of an ERC-20 — but that primitive maps cleanly onto a wide set of real-world payment patterns. The MiniPay surface widens this further: anyone with a phone and a Celo address is reachable.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    T(("TrickleVault<br/>per-second stream"))
    T --> U1["Remote payroll<br/>in emerging markets"]
    T --> U2["Freelancers &<br/>contractors"]
    T --> U3["DAO contributor<br/>compensation"]
    T --> U4["Creator &<br/>gig economy"]

    class T vault
    class U1,U2,U3,U4,U5,U6 use
```

### 1. Remote payroll in emerging markets
**Who:** companies hiring engineers, designers, support staff in LATAM / Africa / SEA where banking is slow or expensive.
**Why Trickle:** worker is paid every second in USDC, withdraws to MiniPay anytime, no IBAN, no SWIFT, no FX desk. Sub-cent gas means even a $10 mid-week withdrawal makes economic sense.

### 2. Freelancers & long-running contracts
**Who:** independent developers, designers, copywriters on month-long engagements.
**Why Trickle:** replaces the awkward 50% upfront / 50% on delivery dance. Client opens a stream for the engagement window; freelancer claims earned value continuously. If the relationship ends, `cancelStream` settles whatever was owed up to that second — no disputes about partial work.

### 3. DAO contributor compensation
**Who:** protocol DAOs, guilds, working groups paying core contributors from a multisig treasury.
**Why Trickle:** one Safe → many streams. Contributors see a live "earned this month" counter. Treasury runway becomes legible (`balance / totalPaidPerSec` = seconds of payroll left). Cancellation is non-punitive — pending pay always settles before the stream closes.

### 4. Creator economy & gig work
**Who:** content platforms paying creators, agencies paying drivers / couriers / micro-task workers.
**Why Trickle:** salary that mirrors how creators actually live (daily cash needs, not monthly cycles). MiniPay's 14M+ install base means the worker doesn't install anything new — the wallet is already there.

### 5. Grants, scholarships & token vesting
**Who:** ecosystem foundations, hackathon sponsors, universities, DAO grant programs.
**Why Trickle:** a grant becomes a stream with a fixed end date instead of a milestone-gated PDF chase. Recipients pull funds as they need them. The same primitive doubles as a vesting schedule for advisors or early team — linear, transparent, revocable.

### 6. Family & domestic remittance
**Who:** workers abroad sending continuous support to family; households paying caregivers, tutors, domestic help.
**Why Trickle:** instead of a chunky monthly transfer with high FX + remittance fees, the recipient receives a continuous USDC stream and withdraws as they need cash. This is the use case Celo + MiniPay was arguably built for.

> Across all six, the protocol is identical. The differentiation is **distribution + cost**: MiniPay puts streams in front of users who already have the wallet, and Celo's fee model makes frequent small withdrawals viable.

---

## Why Celo

| | |
|---|---|
| **Native stablecoins** | cUSD ships at the protocol level; USDC + USDT live as well-known ERC-20s |
| **Sub-cent fees** | A frequent-withdrawal product is unviable on a $3-gas chain |
| **MiniPay distribution** | 14M+ users with a pre-installed wallet — no acquisition cliff |
| **Pay gas in stablecoins** | Users never need to hold CELO to interact |
| **Fast finality** | ~5s block times feel close enough to "real-time" for streaming UX |
| **EVM-equivalent** | Solidity, Foundry, viem, wagmi — zero new tooling to learn |

---

## Trickle vs LlamaPay

| | LlamaPay | **Trickle** |
|---|---|---|
| Per-second salary streaming | Yes | **Yes** |
| Deployed on Celo | No | **Yes — mainnet & sepolia** |
| MiniPay integration | No | **Yes** |
| Mobile-first surface | Web only | **MiniApp** |
| Native cUSD support | No | **Yes** |
| Sub-cent withdraw fees | Chain-dependent | **Yes (Celo)** |
| Gas in stablecoins | No | **Yes (Celo fee abstraction)** |

LlamaPay validated the streaming-payroll category. Trickle ships it where the next billion users actually are.

## Example: Company ABC pays 5 employees

> 5 engineers, $1,000/month each, paid in USDC on Celo Mainnet.

| Step | Action | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `deposit` | Company funds vault with **5,000 USDC** |
| 2 | `createStream` × 5 | Each at `385_802 wei/sec` (≈ $1k/mo in 6-decimal USDC) |
| 3 | Mid-month | Engineer opens MiniPay → sees **$497.31** accrued |
| 4 | `withdraw` | Tx settles in ~5s, gas paid in cUSD, fee `< $0.01` |
| 5 | End of month | Remaining $502.69 still claimable; or top-up & continue |

No payday. No payroll calendar. Just salary that exists in real time.
